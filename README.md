# Quantum Reflection Simulations of Bose-Einstein Condensates

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for simulating the quantum reflection of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) in various potentials using Python. The potentials explored include positive step potentials, negative step potentials, and Casimir-Polder potentials. These simulations provide insights into the wave nature of BECs and their interaction with different types of potentials.

## Features

- **Positive Step Potential**: Simulations of BEC reflection on a sudden increase in potential energy.
- **Negative Step Potential**: Simulations of BEC reflection on a sudden decrease in potential energy.
- **Casimir-Polder Potential**: Simulations of BEC reflection in the presence of a long-range interaction potential resulting from quantum fluctuations.
- **Numerical Solutions**: Implementation of numerical methods to solve the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation for BECs.
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive visualizations of wave function evolution and reflection patterns using Matplotlib.

## Installation

To run the simulations, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- SciPy
